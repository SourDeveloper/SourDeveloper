<h1>Hello there, I'm Sour!</h1>

<h2>I am a web developer mainly, so I code primarily in JS, HTML, and CSS, but occasionally Python, too.</h1>

I use the Discord API a lot, and enjoy working with APIs in general. I don't normally post public repos, so that is the reason to having so few, but I am trying to get better at posting publicly.

If you would like to collaborate on something, feel free to DM me on Discord, @Sour#9691.

*My website (sourdev.com) is out of date because I am trying to update the SSL and it won't let me :(. One I fix that I will update it. I know it is horrible at the moment.*
