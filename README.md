<h1>Hello there, I'm Sour!</h1>

<h2>I am a developer primarily in JavaScript, Python, HTMl, and CSS.</h1>

I use the Discord API a lot, and enjoy working with APIs in general. I have used I don't normally post public repositories, so that is the reason for having so few, but I am trying to get better at posting more public projects.

If you would like to collaborate on something, feel free to DM me on Discord, @Sour#3908.

*My website (sourdev.com) is currently out of date, if you have decided to visit it recently. I am currently working to update it and make it loom a lot nicer!*
